The device uses LoRaWAN to uplink temperature, humidity and precipitation sensor data through calculation.
Data will be sent every 30 ninutes, if there is rain, the sending time will be 5 minutes
Support sensors:
- [Digital humidity and temperature sensor - SHTC3](https://www.sensirion.com/products/catalog/SHTC3/)

### In Arduino IDE:
  -  Add this JSON in Additional Boards Manager URLs [\(Show me how?\)](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360016466340-Add-third-party-platforms-to-the-Boards-Manager-in-Arduino-IDE):

```  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index/main/package_rakwireless.com_rui_index.json
```

  -  Go to **Tool -> Board -> Boards Manager**, search & install **RAKwireless RUI STM32 Boards**
  -  Open ```ATC_Command_RF210.ino``` sketch, seletc **WisDou RAK3172-T Board** from **Tool** menu
  -  Plug in your board and upload

## The Things Network
- Depends on your country region and how you set up your gateway. Please create the correct application with it to be able to receive data
- In Danang, Vietnam we use the [**AS923_2**](https://ns.docs.everynet.io/channel_plans/AS920-923.html) band and [eu1.cloud.thethings.network](https://eu1.cloud.thethings.network/console/)
- You need to **create application** for RainGauge Board

- Select **end device -> Register end device** to create your device

- After creating the device, now you just need to copy **Device address, NwkSKey, AppSKey** and paste it into your code.

- The data sent will be in the default format

- You can change the format of the data to be able to observe changes
