# RainGauge
The device uses LoRaWAN to uplink temperature, humidity and precipitation sensor data through calculation.
Data will be sent every 30 ninutes, if there is rain, the sending time will be 5 minutes
Support sensors:
- [Digital humidity and temperature sensor - SHTC3](https://www.sensirion.com/products/catalog/SHTC3/)

### In Arduino IDE:
  -  Add this JSON in Additional Boards Manager URLs [\(Show me how?\)](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360016466340-Add-third-party-platforms-to-the-Boards-Manager-in-Arduino-IDE):

```  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index/main/package_rakwireless.com_rui_index.json
```

  -  Go to **Tool -> Board -> Boards Manager**, search & install **RAKwireless RUI STM32 Boards**
  -  Open ```ATC_Command_RF210.ino``` sketch, seletc **WisDou RAK3172-T Board** from **Tool** menu
  -  Plug in your board and upload

## The Things Network
- Depends on your country region and how you set up your gateway. Please create the correct application with it to be able to receive data
- In Danang, Vietnam we use the [**AS923_2**](https://ns.docs.everynet.io/channel_plans/AS920-923.html) band and [eu1.cloud.thethings.network](https://eu1.cloud.thethings.network/console/)
- You need to **create application** for RainGauge Board

- Select **end device -> Register end device** to create your device

- After creating the device, now you just need to copy **Device address, NwkSKey, AppSKey** and paste it into your code.

- The data sent will be in the default format
  
![image](https://github.com/XuanMinh201/RainGauge/assets/75436464/e0ee5e85-7242-4a3e-989e-dfcfdc9c6fe4)

- You can change the format of the data to be able to observe changes
